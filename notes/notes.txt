Points I'm learning:
- Trying a different naming convention for simplicity and forcing myself to be
  flexible

- Solidifying my knowledge of rendering triangles using incremental changes
  derived from the math equations

- Debugging linear transformations in code using pencil and paper

I began implementation of clipping. I'm implementing clipping in clip space
using homogeneous coordinates to make things simple and efficient. Today I was
able to clip the left side of a triangle by detecting collisions with the left
side of the frustum and generating geometry and topology information to draw
two triangles that are on screen.
